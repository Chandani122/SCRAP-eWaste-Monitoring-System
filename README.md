# SCRAP - eWaste Monitoring System

## Project Overview

Welcome to the README for our SCRAP - eWaste Monitoring System project! Our project aims to address the problem of e-waste management by providing a software platform for collecting, monitoring, and recycling electronic waste. We have developed a comprehensive solution leveraging modern technologies to facilitate efficient handling of e-waste.

### Key Features:

1. **E-waste Collection Management**: Our system provides a platform for users to schedule pickups for their electronic waste. It streamlines the process of collection by efficiently managing pickup requests and coordinating with collection centers.

2. **Monitoring and Tracking**: We offer real-time monitoring and tracking of e-waste from collection to recycling. This enables organizations to have full visibility into the lifecycle of electronic items and ensures proper handling and recycling procedures are followed.

3. **Recycling Center Management**: Our platform includes features for managing recycling centers, including inventory tracking, processing status, and logistics management. This ensures that recycling centers operate efficiently and can handle incoming e-waste effectively.

4. **User Interface**: We have developed a user-friendly web interface using React for seamless navigation and interaction with the platform. The interface provides intuitive access to the system's features for users and administrators alike.

## Technology Stack

Our solution is built on a robust technology stack, including:

- **Frontend Framework**: React
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)**: Firebase
- **APIs**:
  - Mapbox API for location services
- **Languages**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
- **Collaborative Tools**:
  - GitHub: Utilized for version control and collaboration
